Do you have a song stuck in your head? 
Maybe you only remember a part of the lyrics.

When I met you in the summer
To my heartbeat's sound
We fell in love
As the leaves turned brown
And we could be together, baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon
When I met you in the summer

The song string 1 from Future branch
The song string 2 from Future branch
